Prompts TODO:

The buttons for the Eggs and Quests on the /operations hub page need to be updated to match the buttons under the map titles on the /intel hub page.
The buttons I am talking about are the "operation-map-group-link" buttons, they should match the style of the "dossier-grid-item" cards that we have on the /intel page.
The CSS should be shared and reused, any unused dossier CSS should be discarded or refactored for shared used
