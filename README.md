With every season more Intel becomes available, now this is the place to follow track and hunt for the next intel.

I made this project after the frustration of going to go through multiple websites and reddit posts.
Previously I contributed to [the Red Dead Redemption 2 Collectors map](https://jeanropke.github.io/RDR2CollectorsMap/), which is an inspiration for this map made by [Jeanropke](https://github.com/jeanropke/)
